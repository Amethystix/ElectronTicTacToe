# Electron Tic Tac Toe

### Created by Lauren DiGiovanni

## Why this project?

I've been interested in getting more involved in writing Desktop applications, and since most of my knowledge has to do with Node and other JS frameworks, I decided to use [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) to make my game.

## My aim

I aim to create a desktop application of Tic Tac Toe, and later implement online multiplayer features.

## Current progress

February 14th was the day this project began, and the day I wrote this README, so progress is only at its infant stages.  I've only just begun to piece together the functions and files that I'll need.
